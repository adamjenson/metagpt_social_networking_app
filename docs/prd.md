## UI Design draft:
The app will have a clean and modern design with a user-friendly interface. The main screen will have a navigation bar at the bottom for easy access to different sections of the app. The user profile page will allow users to customize their profile picture and personal information. The home feed will display posts from friends and groups, with options to like, comment, and share. The discover page will show recommended groups and communities based on the user's interests. Notifications will be displayed in a separate tab, and users will be able to easily send messages and friend requests to other users.

## Anything UNCLEAR:
There are no unclear points.
