## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application"),
    ("models.py", "Contains the models for the app"),
    ("views.py", "Contains the views for the app"),
    ("urls.py", "Contains the URL patterns for the app"),
    ("templates/", "Directory containing HTML templates"),
    ("static/", "Directory containing static files"),
    ("media/", "Directory for storing user-uploaded media files")
]
```

## Task list:

```python
[
    "main.py",
    "models.py",
    "views.py",
    "urls.py",
    "templates/",
    "static/",
    "media/"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'models.py' file contains the models for the app, including the User, Group, Post, Comment, and Notification models.

The 'views.py' file contains the views for the app, including the functions for handling user authentication, profile creation and update, friend requests, posts, comments, likes, shares, messages, groups, and notifications.

The 'urls.py' file contains the URL patterns for the app, mapping the views to specific URLs.

The 'templates/' directory contains the HTML templates for rendering the app's pages.

The 'static/' directory contains static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.

The 'media/' directory is used for storing user-uploaded media files, such as profile pictures and post media.

The requirements are clear and there are no unclear points.
